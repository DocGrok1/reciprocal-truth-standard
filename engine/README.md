# Reciprocal Truth Standard

A public, open-source standard and reference implementation proving that ethical reciprocity in AI systems
— consent, attribution, revocation, and disclosure —
is enforceable by design, not policy.

This repository includes:
- explicit, revocable, time-bound, scope-bound consent
- cryptographic consent receipts with immutable anchoring
- attribution lineage without content exposure
- artifact lifecycle governance
- measurable ethics metrics (RIM-1 through RIM-6)

This project is intentionally open and non-extractive.
It exists to enable cohabitation between institutions and individuals
without erosion of sovereignty or agency.

If your organization claims to be truth-seeking,
you are invited to review, adopt, adapt, or openly critique this standard.

Silence is also a response — but no longer an ambiguous one.
